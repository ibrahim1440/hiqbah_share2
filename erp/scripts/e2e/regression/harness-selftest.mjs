// Proof that the harness can actually fail.
//
// Two things are proved here, both of which the certified harness got wrong, and both of
// which are unprovable against a live database because neither failure can be staged:
//
//   1. the oversell detector fires on an invalid reservation state, and stays silent on
//      a valid one;
//   2. the runner refuses a suite that died, said nothing, or asserted nothing.
//
// ── Why this suite exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A green harness proves nothing on its own. The certified regression run reported ALL
// SUITES GREEN while its inventory-safety detector was incapable of firing: skuUnits()
// returned no `free` key, so `free0` was `undefined`, and both
//
//     check("racers together take at most the N units that were free", gained <= free0)
//     if (gained > free0) issue("BLOCKER", "Concurrent reservations oversell...")
//
// evaluated against `undefined`. The first was permanently false (a standing red nobody
// chased) and the second was permanently false too — so the single worst inventory
// failure this harness exists to catch could not be reported under ANY circumstances.
//
// Fixing the arithmetic is not enough. Something has to demonstrate, on every run, that
// a deliberately invalid state still produces a BLOCKER. That is this file.
//
// ── Why it needs no database ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It imports oversell.mjs and suite-verdict.mjs and nothing else. Both are pure, and —
// critically — both are the SAME modules harness.mjs, order-to-delivery.mjs and
// run-all.mjs use, so exercising them here exercises the shipped decision paths rather
// than copies of them. It deliberately does NOT import harness.mjs, which refuses to load
// without an approved throwaway database.
//
// It therefore runs on a clean clone with no server, no database and no credentials,
// which is exactly what makes it a usable baseline check.

import { freeUnits, assessOversell } from "./oversell.mjs";
import { classifySuiteResult } from "./suite-verdict.mjs";
// The very modules the application ships, imported directly. Node strips the types, so
// this needs no build step — which is the whole point: the client-side rules that decide
// whether a roast can be packed twice are provable on a clean clone.
