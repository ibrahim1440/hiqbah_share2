// RESET SAFETY — R2.2B closure.
//
// Two separate things are proved here, and they are the two that a reset endpoint can get
// catastrophically wrong.
//
// 1. ATOMICITY. A reset deletes seventeen tables in a fixed order. If those deletes were
//    independently committed, a failure partway through would leave a half-erased database:
//    inventory movements and finished stock gone, the batches and orders that explain them
//    still present. That is worse than either outcome on its own, and it is unrecoverable
//    without a backup. Both routes issue their deletes through the array form of
//    prisma.$transaction, which is a single BEGIN/COMMIT — and section B proves the
//    invariant on the real delete order rather than taking that on trust.
//
// 2. THE ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY. Privilege, a typed confirmation phrase and a PIN
//    re-verification all establish that a human meant to do this. None of them establish
//    WHICH DATABASE is about to be emptied. The deny-by-default guard is what does, and
//    every permutation of it is enumerated in harness-selftest, where it can be exercised
//    with no server and no risk. What is proved HERE is the other half: that when the guard
//    does allow a reset, the reset actually works, and works in an order that preserves the
//    RESTRICT on packaging history.
//
// ── This suite destroys the whole database, so it runs LAST ──────────────────
// Section C really does wipe everything. That is the behaviour under test: a training reset
// is supposed to be wholesale. It is registered as the final suite so nothing downstream
// depends on what it removes, and it only ever runs against the throwaway database
// harness.mjs will accept.
