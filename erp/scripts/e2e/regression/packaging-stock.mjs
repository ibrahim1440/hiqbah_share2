// PACKAGING STOCK INTEGRITY — R2.1.
//
// The kilogram packaging path writes finished stock, and every defect below is a way it
// wrote the wrong number. They are proved here against the running application rather than
// argued about, because all four are arithmetic that only shows up once something else has
// already moved the balance — a dispatch, a second pack, or another packer.
//
//   A-1  the lot's availableQty was ASSIGNED the cumulative packed weight instead of being
//        incremented by this pack's delta. Once anything had shipped off the lot, the next
//        pack silently resurrected it: 10 kg roasted, 6 packed, 4 dispatched, 4 more packed
//        left 10 kg on the shelf where 6 were physically present.
//   A-2  the batch was read, and every quantity derived from it, OUTSIDE the transaction,
//        so two packers on one batch each computed from the same stale bag counters and the
//        last writer won — losing the other's bags while the ledger still recorded both.
//   B-1  the kilogram path never drew down RoastingBatch.roastedAvailableKg, so the same
//        roasted coffee stayed on the books as packable after it had been packed.
//   L-1  explodeBom counted roasted stock that cannot be packed at all — batches still
//        awaiting QC, rejected batches, and batches consumed into a blend.
//   N-1  the auto-reservation decided eligibility from an unlocked read. A cancellation
//        committing in the same window never touches OrderItem, so the compare-and-swap
//        still matched and the reservation landed on a dead order.
//   SEC-1 body.productSkuId was written onto the lot with no validation at all.
//
// Every assertion is on state read back from the database, never on the response body.
