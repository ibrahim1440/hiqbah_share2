# Migration Drift and Manual DB Constraints

> **Status: Migration baseline established 2026-05-22. Schema drift resolved. `_prisma_migrations` contains three applied migrations: `20260522000000_baseline`, `20260526115344_add_qc_final_decision_reason`, `20260528084853_add_rate_limit`. Old migrations archived at `prisma/migrations_archive_before_baseline_20260522/`.**

## 0. Release Contract — Build and Migration Are Separate

> **The application build never applies migrations.** Compiling the application cannot
> change any database schema.

| Step | Command | Resolves to | Touches the database |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application build | `npm run build` | `prisma generate && next build` | **No** |
| Database migration | `npm run db:migrate` | `prisma migrate deploy` | **Yes — deliberately** |

1. `npm run build` does **not** apply migrations. It generates the Prisma client and
   compiles the application.
2. Migration is an explicit release step, run on its own and never as a build side effect.
3. Where a release includes schema changes, run `npm run db:migrate` against the intended
   environment **before** deploying or starting the application against it.
4. Positively verify the database target before running it — host, database name and
   environment — rather than trusting whatever `DATABASE_URL` is currently set to.
5. A production migration must never be triggered merely by compiling or building.
6. Never use `prisma migrate dev`, `prisma migrate reset` or `prisma db push` to migrate
   production. `prisma migrate deploy` is the only production migration command.

There is no CI/CD pipeline committed to this repository. Both commands are run manually by
whoever performs the release, which is exactly why the migration step must be deliberate.

### RP-2 — build-time datasource shape dependency

> **Technical debt.** It is not a reason to expose Production credentials during a build.

`npm run build` must never require Production database credentials merely to compile.

It does, however, currently require `DATABASE_URL` to be present and *PostgreSQL-shaped*.
`src/lib/db.ts` selects its driver adapter from the URL scheme: a `postgresql://` or
`postgres://` prefix selects the Postgres adapter, while anything else — including an unset
variable — selects the SQLite adapter, which is incompatible with the schema's `postgres`
provider and fails during page-data collection.

That is a dependency on the *shape* of the value, not on reaching a database. RP-1
certification verified the build completing against
`postgresql://nouser:nopass@127.0.0.1:1/nodb` — an address with no listener. Had the build
attempted a connection it would have failed.

**For build-only or CI compilation, where no database access is required, use a
non-sensitive, non-routable or intentionally unreachable PostgreSQL-shaped value rather than
Production credentials.** The real `DATABASE_URL` is needed only for:

- `npm run db:migrate`
- application runtime / startup
- operations that genuinely require database access

An unreachable value is also a useful fail-closed control. This is a statement about the
build as certified here, not a guarantee that no future build-time code will ever query a
database: if such code is introduced, a build pointed at an unreachable address fails loudly
instead of quietly reaching Production.

## 1. Current Status

### Schema vs Live Database

`schema.prisma` **matches the live database exactly.**

Running the following command returns an empty migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate diff \
  --from-schema prisma/schema.prisma \
  --to-config-datasource \
  --script
# Output: "-- This is an empty migration."
```

There is no active schema mismatch. Every table, column, index, foreign key, and enum
defined in `schema.prisma` exists in the live database with the correct structure.

### Historical Context — Drift Resolved 2026-05-22

The drift was **migration-history tracking drift only**, not a live schema mismatch.

The project previously used `prisma db push` (and in some cases `prisma db execute`) as its
primary schema-change workflow instead of `prisma migrate dev` + `prisma migrate deploy`. As a
result, the `_prisma_migrations` table and the `prisma/migrations/` directory did not fully
represent the schema running in production.

This was resolved on 2026-05-22 by executing the full replacement baseline (Option A — see
Section 5). `_prisma_migrations` now tracks a single row: `20260522000000_baseline`.

**Pre-baseline tables that had no migration (all now covered by baseline):**
`BlendIngredient`, `CuppingSessionBatch`, `CustomerRoastPreference`, `FinishedGoodsLot`,
`InventoryMovement`, `LoginAttempt`, `ProductSKU`, `ProductionOrder`, `PurchaseRecord`,
`Supplier`.

**Pre-baseline columns with no migration (all now covered):**
`Employee.pinHash`; `OrderItem.productId`, `productSkuId`; `RoastingBatch.isBlend`,
`productId`, `productionOrderId`; `QcRecord.colorGround`, `colorWhole`;
`CoffeeProduct.defaultGreenBeanId`, `expectedRoastLoss`; `CuppingSession.sessionToken`;
`CuppingScore.sessionBatchId`.

**Pre-baseline untracked enums (all now covered):**
`PurchaseType`, `MovementType`, `InventoryCategory`, `SourceDocType`, `LotStatus`,
`ProductionOrderStatus`.

**Pre-baseline index replacement (now covered):**
The old `RoastingBatch_batchNumber_key` (single-column unique on `batchNumber`) was replaced
by `RoastingBatch_greenBeanId_batchNumber_key` (composite unique). The baseline captures
the composite index; the old single-column index is not present.

## 2. Dangerous Commands — Do Not Run Without Explicit Approval

> **Baseline established 2026-05-22.** The commands below document their previous danger and their updated status. `prisma migrate deploy` and `prisma migrate dev` are now unblocked. `prisma migrate reset` and `prisma db push` remain off-limits for production.

| Command | Why it is dangerous |
|---|---|
| `prisma migrate dev` | **Safe for local development as of 2026-05-22.** The baseline is in sync. Use this to generate new tracked migration files for schema changes. Review generated SQL before committing. Never run in production. |
| `prisma migrate deploy` | **The production migration command as of 2026-05-22 — invoked ONLY by the explicit operator action `npm run db:migrate:deploy`, never by `npm run build` and never by a Vercel deployment.** The baseline ensures no pending migrations fail. Verify the target database before running it. |
| `prisma migrate reset` | Drops and recreates the entire database — all data is destroyed |
| `prisma db push` (without explicit approval) | Continues to worsen migration-history drift. Must not be used as a routine schema change tool going forward |

---

## 3. Manual Database Constraints Added Outside Prisma Migrations

The following five CHECK constraints were added directly to the live database using
`prisma db execute`. The first four were applied on 2026-05-19; the fifth,
`FinishedGoodsLot_availableQty_non_negative`, was applied on 2026-05-22. They enforce
non-negative inventory quantities at the database level.

| Constraint name | Table | Column | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GreenBean_quantityKg_non_negative` | `GreenBean` | `quantityKg` | `>= 0` |
| `RoastingBatch_greenBeanQuantity_positive` | `RoastingBatch` | `greenBeanQuantity` | `> 0` |
| `RoastingBatch_roastedBeanQuantity_non_negative` | `RoastingBatch` | `roastedBeanQuantity` | `>= 0` |
| `RoastingBatch_wasteQuantity_non_negative` | `RoastingBatch` | `wasteQuantity` | `>= 0` |
| `FinishedGoodsLot_availableQty_non_negative` | `FinishedGoodsLot` | `availableQty` | `>= 0` |

These were verified to exist in the database via `information_schema.check_constraints`
immediately after application. `FinishedGoodsLot_availableQty_non_negative` was verified
via `information_schema.check_constraints`: `check_clause = ("availableQty" >= (0)::double precision)`.

Rollback SQL (if ever needed):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "GreenBean"      DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "GreenBean_quantityKg_non_negative";
ALTER TABLE "RoastingBatch"  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "RoastingBatch_greenBeanQuantity_positive";
ALTER TABLE "RoastingBatch"  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "RoastingBatch_roastedBeanQuantity_non_negative";
ALTER TABLE "RoastingBatch"  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "RoastingBatch_wasteQuantity_non_negative";
ALTER TABLE "FinishedGoodsLot" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "FinishedGoodsLot_availableQty_non_negative";
```

## 3a. Manual CHECK Constraints Embedded in a Migration File (Accounting S0)

> **Status: APPLIED TO DEMO DB ONLY.** Applied via `npx prisma migrate deploy` against
> the demo Neon endpoint as migration `20260626130557_add_accounting_s0_foundation`.
> **Not applied to production.** Production deployment of this migration is a separate,
> explicitly approved step and has not occurred.

Unlike the five constraints in Section 3 (which were applied out-of-band against a
live database via `prisma db execute` and exist in no migration file), the two
constraints below were added by hand directly into a generated migration's SQL file
*before* that migration was ever applied — the same technique, but tracked in version
control from the start rather than reconciled after the fact.

| Constraint name | Table | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `JournalEntryLine_debit_credit_exclusive_positive` | `JournalEntryLine` | `(debit > 0 AND credit = 0) OR (debit = 0 AND credit > 0)` |
| `FiscalPeriod_startDate_before_endDate` | `FiscalPeriod` | `startDate <= endDate` |

**Why these are manual SQL constraints:** Prisma's schema language has no `@check`/`@@check`
attribute (see Section 4 below). `JournalEntryLine_debit_credit_exclusive_positive` enforces,
in one constraint, all four S0 ledger-line rules at once: debit ≥ 0, credit ≥ 0, the two are
never both positive, and the two are never both zero — exactly one side of every journal line
must be positive. `FiscalPeriod_startDate_before_endDate` prevents a fiscal period from ever
being recorded with its end date before its start date.

**Migration ownership:** Both constraints belong to
`prisma/migrations/20260626130557_add_accounting_s0_foundation/migration.sql`, appended by
hand after Prisma's auto-generated `CREATE TABLE`/`ADD CONSTRAINT` statements in that same
file, immediately before the foreign key section ends.

**They must not be removed silently.** If this migration is ever regenerated, edited, or
squashed, both `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT` statements must be preserved or reproduced —
same rule as the five P0 constraints in Section 3. Removing either constraint would allow a
journal line with negative amounts, both sides zero, both sides positive, or a fiscal period
with an inverted date range to be written directly into the ledger, bypassing the
application-layer checks in `src/lib/accounting/validation.ts`.

Rollback SQL (if ever needed, only after the migration has been applied):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "JournalEntryLine" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "JournalEntryLine_debit_credit_exclusive_positive";
ALTER TABLE "FiscalPeriod" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "FiscalPeriod_startDate_before_endDate";
```

---

## 3b. Manual CHECK Constraints Embedded in a Migration File (Shelf Allocation)

> **Status: APPLIED TO THE LOCAL TEST DATABASE ONLY.** Shipped as migration
> `20260826090000_add_shelf_allocation`. It has not been deployed to the demo or
> production Neon endpoints — that remains a separate, explicitly approved step.

Same technique as Section 3a: the constraints live inside the migration file, in version
control from the start.

| Constraint name | Table | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `FinishedGoodsLot_reservedQty_within_available` | `FinishedGoodsLot` | `reservedQty >= 0 AND reservedQty <= availableQty` |
| `StockAllocation_quantityKg_positive` | `StockAllocation` | `quantityKg > 0` |

`FinishedGoodsLot_reservedQty_within_available` is the invariant the whole shelf-first
mechanism rests on: a lot may never promise more coffee than it physically holds. The
reservation path in `src/lib/services/shelf-allocation.ts` guards this in its own
conditional `UPDATE`, but the constraint is what makes the rule true regardless of which
code path writes the row.

**Backfill:** none required. `reservedQty` was added with `DEFAULT 0`, which is the
correct historical value — before this migration nothing could reserve stock, so no
kilogram was ever promised without being shipped in the same transaction. Verified against
a populated database (44 `RoastingBatch`, 50 `OrderItem`, 44 `Delivery` rows): the
migration applies with no errors and no data change beyond the new column default.

**They must not be removed silently** — same rule as Sections 3 and 3a.

Rollback SQL (if ever needed, only after the migration has been applied):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "FinishedGoodsLot" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "FinishedGoodsLot_reservedQty_within_available";
ALTER TABLE "StockAllocation" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "StockAllocation_quantityKg_positive";
```

---

## 3c. Nullable Column Widening (Roast to Stock)

> **Status: APPLIED TO THE LOCAL TEST DATABASE ONLY.** Migration
> `20260827090000_allow_roast_to_stock`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE "RoastingBatch" ALTER COLUMN "orderItemId" DROP NOT NULL;
```

No CHECK constraint and no backfill: every existing row already carries an order item, so the
widening rewrites nothing.

**Reversibility caveat.** Re-adding `SET NOT NULL` succeeds only while no stock batch exists.
Once one has been created the reverse migration will fail, and the rows would have to be
deleted or reassigned first. This is the intended one-way door — a stock batch is a batch that
genuinely belongs to no order.

---

## 4. Prisma Cannot Represent These CHECK Constraints

Prisma's schema language (`schema.prisma`) has no `@check` or `@@check` attribute.
The five constraints above are **invisible to Prisma's schema engine**:

- `prisma migrate diff` will never generate or detect them in either direction.
- Running `prisma migrate dev` in the future may generate a migration that rewrites
  `GreenBean` or `RoastingBatch` without preserving these constraints, silently dropping them.
- `prisma db push` will also silently drop them if it rewrites affected tables.

**Any future migration that touches `GreenBean`, `RoastingBatch`, or `FinishedGoodsLot` must be reviewed to ensure these five constraints are not silently dropped.** If a migration regenerates any of these tables, the five `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT` statements must be appended manually before the migration is applied.

---

## 5. Baseline Execution Record — Completed 2026-05-22

Option A (Full Replacement Baseline) was executed on 2026-05-22. The following steps
were performed in order:

1. **Neon snapshot created:** `before-migration-baseline-20260522` (production branch, never expires).
2. **`_prisma_migrations` backup:** Saved to `/tmp/hiqbah_migrations_backup_20260522.json` with full restore SQL for the three deleted rows.
3. **Baseline SQL generated:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma --script > /tmp/hiqbah_baseline_generated.sql
   ```
   Output: 556 lines — 22 CREATE TABLE, 6 CREATE TYPE, 15 CREATE INDEX/UNIQUE INDEX, 33 ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT. No INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, or DROP statements.
4. **Five P0 CHECK constraints appended manually** to the bottom of the SQL (Prisma cannot generate them — see Sections 3 and 4).
5. **Baseline migration file created:** `prisma/migrations/20260522000000_baseline/migration.sql` (577 lines).
6. **Old migration directories archived:** Moved to `prisma/migrations_archive_before_baseline_20260522/`. The four directories (`20260506142657_init`, `20260510000000_add_system_config`, `20260510000001_add_cupping`, `20260511000000_green_bean_bilingual`) are preserved there.
7. **Old `_prisma_migrations` rows deleted:** Three rows (`init`, `add_system_config`, `add_cupping`) deleted via targeted `DELETE WHERE migration_name IN (...)`. `20260511000000_green_bean_bilingual` was never in the table and was not touched.
8. **Baseline marked applied:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260522000000_baseline
   ```
9. **Empty diff confirmed:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema prisma/schema.prisma --to-config-datasource --script
   # Output: -- This is an empty migration.
   ```
10. **`package.json` build script updated:**
    - `"build"`: `prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build` — *(historical: this coupling was later removed; the build no longer migrates. See the banner at the top of this document.)*
      > **Superseded.** `"build"` is now `tsx scripts/validate-env.ts && prisma generate && next build`;
      > migrations run explicitly via `npm run db:migrate:deploy`. The line above records the
      > 2026-05-22 state.
    - `"db:push"` → renamed to `"db:push:local"`: `prisma db push` (local/prototype only)

### Baseline SQL Review Checklist (Executed)

These items were verified before the baseline was marked applied:

- [x] No `DROP TABLE` statements
- [x] No `DROP COLUMN` statements
- [x] No `DROP CONSTRAINT` statements other than the intentional batchNumber index replacement
- [x] No `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` statements
- [x] No `SET NOT NULL` on columns that could contain NULL values in existing data
- [x] The five P0 CHECK constraint `ALTER TABLE` statements are present
- [x] If a migration touches `GreenBean`, `RoastingBatch`, or `FinishedGoodsLot`, verify the five P0 constraints are not dropped
- [x] If a migration regenerates those tables, manually add the `ADD CONSTRAINT` statements back
- [x] All FK `ON DELETE` behaviors match `schema.prisma` (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT)
- [x] The `SystemConfig` singleton `INSERT INTO "SystemConfig" ("id") VALUES ('singleton')` is NOT included (row already exists in the DB)

## 6. Recommended Future Process for Schema Changes

> Apply this process before any future schema additions, including planned items such as
> `Role`/RBAC tables.

**Steps in order:**

**a. ~~Establish the migration baseline first~~ — Complete as of 2026-05-22.** `_prisma_migrations` contains a single row: `20260522000000_baseline`. The active `prisma/migrations/` directory contains only the baseline and `migration_lock.toml`. Future schema changes may now proceed via `prisma migrate dev` locally followed by `prisma migrate deploy` in production.

**b. Generate the proposed SQL for review before applying:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate diff \
     --from-schema prisma/schema.prisma \
     --to-schema prisma/schema_with_new_changes.prisma \
     --script
   ```
   Review for destructive operations before touching the database.

**c. Inspect for CHECK constraint impact.** If the migration touches `GreenBean`,
   `RoastingBatch`, or `FinishedGoodsLot`, verify the five P0 constraints are not dropped.
   If the migration regenerates those tables, manually add the `ADD CONSTRAINT` statements back.

**d. Apply via `prisma migrate dev` only after baseline and review are complete.**
   This generates a tracked migration file and applies it to the DB in a single step.

**e. Document any new `prisma db execute` constraints** in this file immediately after
   applying them. Do not rely on memory or git history alone.

---

## 7. Safe Commands Reference

| Command | Safety | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema ... --to-config-datasource --script` | Read-only | Reports drift; does not modify DB or files |
| `npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema ... --script` | Read-only | Generates full schema SQL for review |
| `npx prisma db execute --stdin` | Write — requires explicit approval | Used for targeted SQL not representable in schema.prisma (e.g., CHECK constraints) |
| `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <name>` | Write — requires explicit approval | Records a migration as applied without running it; only use after full SQL review |
| `npx prisma migrate deploy` | **Production migration command** — run explicitly via `npm run db:migrate:deploy`; **not** part of `build` | Safe. Baseline ensures no pending migrations fail. Requires DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL, run against a positively verified target database. |
| `npx prisma migrate dev` | **Safe for local development** | Generates tracked migration files for schema changes. Review generated SQL before committing. Never run in production. |
| `npx prisma studio` | Read-only UI | Safe to run at any time |

---

## 8. Warning: db push Is Not an Acceptable Schema Change Workflow

> **This project must not rely on `prisma db push` as the normal schema change workflow
> going forward.**

`db push` applies schema changes directly to the database without creating a migration file.
It has no rollback capability, creates no audit trail, and makes `prisma migrate deploy`
(the standard production deployment command) unsafe to run.

**These consequences existed before 2026-05-22 and are now resolved by the baseline:**
- ~~Half the database schema had no migration coverage~~ — all 22 tables covered by `20260522000000_baseline`.
- ~~`migrate deploy` would fail in CI or a fresh environment~~ — `migrate deploy` succeeds against a fresh environment; it is the production migration command, run as an explicit operator step via `npm run db:migrate:deploy`, not as part of the build.
- ~~A future database restore from migrations would produce an incomplete schema~~ — the baseline covers the full schema.
- ~~Automated rollback of a bad deploy is not possible via the migration system~~ — the Neon snapshot `before-migration-baseline-20260522` provides a restore point; future migrations are tracked and reversible.

From this point forward, all schema changes must go through `prisma migrate dev` locally
and `prisma migrate deploy` in production. Migration files must be committed to version
control before being applied to the production database.

The only exception is constraints not representable in Prisma's schema language (such as
the five P0 CHECK constraints above), which must be applied via `prisma db execute` with
explicit approval and documented in this file.
