// ─── Completion delivery gate ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An order may reach "Completed" only once every line has actually shipped.
//
// Reaching Ready for Shipping is a statement about STOCK — preparation review found cover
// for the order — not about fulfilment. Completion used to check only that status plus the
// caller's authority, so an order with nothing delivered could be closed as fulfilled, and
// the release that runs immediately afterwards would hand its reserved coffee back to the
// free pool. The result was a Completed order with deliveredUnits = 0, no Delivery rows,
// and nothing in the ledger recording that anything had failed to ship.
//
// The comparison is PER LINE and discriminated on quantityUnits, because this model has
// two kinds of line and only one of them counts in units:
//
//   SKU line (quantityUnits non-null) — units are authoritative and quantityKg is a
//     projection of them (see the note at the top of finished-products.ts). Comparing
//     kilograms here would gate on a derived value rather than on the real one.
//   Legacy kilogram line (quantityUnits null) — rows predating SKU-based ordering. They
//     carry no units at all, so units cannot answer the question and kilograms are the
//     only authority they have. Gating those on units would make every one of them
//     permanently uncompletable, which is why this is not simply
//     `deliveredUnits === quantityUnits`.
//
// Stated as EXACT delivery, not "at least enough". Completed certifies an internally
// consistent fulfilment state, so the gate fails closed in both directions: a line that
// shipped MORE than it ordered is as inconsistent as one that shipped less, and an
// integrity gate must not wave it through. Deliberately not resting on "the delivery route
// makes over-delivery impossible" — that argument protects data this route creates, not
// historical or corrupted rows, which are exactly what a gate is for.
//
// Completion additionally requires that the order hold NO live RESERVED allocation. A
// fully delivered line holds none, because both delivery paths trim reservations down to
// the remaining demand as their last act; a reservation surviving full delivery is
// therefore an inconsistent state. Completion refuses it and leaves it untouched rather
// than quietly releasing it — silently normalising that state is how the original defect
// stayed invisible. Cancel keeps releasing reservations under its own contract; only
// completion is strict, because only completion claims the order was fulfilled.

//
//   "Preparing"          — reviewed, and at least one line needs more than the shelf holds.
//                          This is the ordinary production case.
//   "Ready for Shipping" — reviewed, and every line was shelf-covered AT REVIEW TIME.
//                          Included deliberately: coverage can go stale afterwards when
//                          another order frees or claims stock, and the roasting route
//                          derives its ceiling from live reservations rather than the

//                          check remains the authority on whether anything is left to make.
//
// Everything else is excluded for a specific reason. "Waiting Approval" has not been
// approved — production there consumes green coffee for an order that may never be agreed.
// "Waiting Preparation Review" is approved but unreviewed: review is what reserves shelf
// stock and computes the shortfall, so roasting first produces against a quantity nobody

/**
 * Late lifecycle-serialization barrier for order-backed production.
 *
 * Call this INSIDE the production transaction, after the OrderItem and inventory work and
 * immediately before commit. It locks the parent Order row and re-evaluates eligibility
 * against transaction-current committed state, so a Hold or Cancel that committed while
 * this transaction was running is seen and the whole transaction rolls back.
 *
 * ── Why the lock is taken here and not earlier ─────────────────────────────
 * The roasting transaction writes OrderItem (recalcOrderItemStatus) before it finishes, and
 * preparation-review writes OrderItem and then Order. Taking Order first in production
 * would invert that and deadlock: production would hold Order and wait for OrderItem while
 * review held OrderItem and waited for Order. Acquiring Order last keeps production in the
 * same direction review already uses — OrderItem then Order — so no cycle exists.
 *
 * ── Why FOR UPDATE OF o, and not a conditional UPDATE ─────────────────────
 * FOR UPDATE takes the same conflicting row lock a status transition needs, without writing
 * anything: no business-visible timestamp is touched. Under READ COMMITTED, once the lock
 * is granted Postgres re-reads the latest committed version of the row, so the values
 * returned here are transaction-current rather than from this transaction's snapshot. The
 * OF o restricts the lock to the Order row: locking the joined OrderItem too would put an
 * OrderItem lock AFTER Order in the roasting path and reintroduce the inversion above.
 *
 * ── Why preparationDecision may be read under this same lock ──────────────
 * It is serialized transitively rather than directly, which is sound only while all of the
 * following hold — verified at the time of writing:
 *   1. preparation-review is the ONLY writer of OrderItem.preparationDecision in the
 *      application (every other reference in src/ is a read).
 *   2. It never writes null: decisionFor returns one of three non-null literals, so a
 *      decision can go null -> decided or decided -> decided', never decided -> null.
 *      (Re-review DOES overwrite an existing decision — the weaker "never becomes null" is
 *      the property this argument needs, not "only ever set once".)
 *   3. That same transaction always writes the parent Order row before commit
 *      (order.updateMany, unconditional, after every OrderItem update).
 * Because of (3), no review can commit a decision change while this lock is held; because
 * of (2), a decision that is already non-null cannot become null under us. If a future
 * change writes preparationDecision without touching the Order row, this argument breaks
 * and the decision must be locked directly.

// ─── Lifecycle lock ordering ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE INVARIANT, for every transaction that changes operational state for an order:
//
//     StockAllocation(id ASC) → FinishedGoodsLot(id ASC) → OrderItem(id ASC) → Order
//
// Equivalently, and easier to check in review: never take a StockAllocation or
// FinishedGoodsLot lock while already holding a conflicting lock on an Order or an
// OrderItem. GreenBean and RoastingBatch may be locked before all of these; ProductionOrder
// may be locked any time after OrderItem; advisory locks 7761/7762/7763 keep their places.
//
// ── Why StockAllocation before FinishedGoodsLot ───────────────────────────
// It is the order the paths that take conflicting locks on EXISTING rows already use:
// releaseShelfStock, releaseFinishedUnits and consumeFinishedUnits all update the
// allocation first and the lot second. The reserve paths look inverted — they update the
// lot and then create the allocation — but that second step is an INSERT of a new row,
// which cannot wait on a row another transaction holds, so no StockAllocation → wait edge
// exists there and the two do not form a cycle.
//
// The two release paths iterate allocations in opposite directions (releaseShelfStock
// newest-first, consumeFinishedUnits oldest-first). That is safe only because they operate
// on disjoint row sets by construction — kilogram allocations have quantityUnits NULL and
// unit allocations have it NOT NULL, and each path filters on exactly that. Their comments
// say so, and this ordering depends on it staying true.
//
// Multiple rows are always locked in primary-key order so that two transactions locking
// overlapping sets take them in the same sequence rather than whatever order the planner
// returns.

/**
 * Take the row locks on a set of finished-goods lots, in the one canonical order.
 *
 * The lot is the resource this system contends on most, and it was being acquired in four
 * different orders: the reserve paths walked candidates oldest-first (createdAt), the trim
 * paths walked them newest-first — the exact opposite — the bulk release did it in whatever
 * order the planner chose, and the two lifecycle helpers used id. Two transactions touching
 * the same pair of lots through different paths could therefore take them in opposite
 * directions and cycle. `id` wins as the canonical order because it is already what
 * lockOrderLifecycleResources and lockDeliveryResources use, it is stable and unique, and
 * unlike createdAt it cannot tie.
 *
 * This locks, it does not select. FIFO is a business rule about WHICH coffee leaves the
 * shelf next and it is untouched: callers still choose their lots oldest-first and still
 * draw them down in that order. They simply hold every lock before the first mutation, so
 * the order they then mutate in cannot matter.
 *
 * One extra round trip per call, which on this deployment is about 167 ms. That is the
 * price of the guarantee; it is one statement, and where the caller already holds the locks
 * (delivery and cancellation pre-lock through their own helpers) it returns immediately.

// Why toFixed(3) + Number(...) is safe (not naive float equality): toFixed produces a
