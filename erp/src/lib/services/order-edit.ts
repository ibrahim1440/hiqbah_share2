 * Structurally editing an order that already exists.

 * line is for. All of it used to happen in one route that knew about kilograms and nothing
 * else, applied its changes outside any transaction, and asked no questions about the
 * order's state.
 *
 * The three things that made it dangerous:
 *
 *   - a SKU line's quantity lives in quantityUnits and its kilograms are DERIVED from it,
 *     but the route read and wrote only kilograms. Editing such a line rewrote the derived
 *     figure and left the authoritative one behind, and creating one set productSkuId
 *     without any units at all — the single shape the rest of the unit logic assumes cannot
 *     exist;
 *   - shrinking a line left its reservations untouched, so stock stayed promised to demand
 *     that no longer existed, and removing a line handed back only the kilogram half,
 *     leaving FinishedGoodsLot.unitsReserved counting units for a line that had been
 *     deleted;
 *   - and the quantity is the same demand that production scheduling and order-backed
 *     roasting serialise on. They take pg_advisory_xact_lock(7762, advisoryKey(itemId));
 *     the edit took nothing, so it could move the demand out from under either of them.

 * scheduled against a line shrunk to 8 — because it never considered reservations at all,
 * and it refused safe edits on a production order that had already been mostly packed.

 * Coffee roasted straight against the line with no production order behind it is invisible
 * to that equation: neither delivered, nor reserved, nor scheduled. Shrinking below it would
 * strand it, so it is checked on its own, on the kilogram axis it is measured in. Roast that
 * a production order IS holding is deliberately not checked here — it is already represented,
 * as produced units or as the remainder still scheduled, and counting it twice would refuse
